i can't stand being the cause of the tears on your cheeks
theres a lump in my throat and it won't let me speak
you've been asking to talk, i've been putting it off
cause i'm scared of letting you win form the lies that i keep

and i know the life that i'm chasing is a waste of time
and i don't wanna said it, but i've been out of control
and i'm ready to face it, baby once and for all
i'm so tired of running, i'm scared of letting you down
it been a lonely road but its all over now
its just us from here on out

and i've hear peaple talk about love just for something to say
and this modern world we could live an then die in a day
its
